* SDL + FEMTOLISP + RIGS OF RODS

** LINUX ONLY

To the test directory, I added femtolisp from Jeff Bezonson. I added
'graphics.c,' which exposes a lisp built-in, "graphics-demo." After
building and running "./flisp" in the test directory, type "(graphics-demo)" to
see one of the standard SDL test programs running from lisp.

I plan to add some physics pulled from Rigs-of-Rods, callable from lisp. This
work will be manual labor because the original Rigs-of-Rods is a monolithic game
rather than a collection of components.
